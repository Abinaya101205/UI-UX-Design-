Description (Task 1)

The presented interface is an improved version of the Amazon.in home screen, designed with a focus on enhanced usability, visual clarity, and user engagement. The layout follows a structured and user-centered design approach, ensuring that users can easily browse products, access services, and complete shopping tasks efficiently.

At the top of the interface, the header section establishes strong brand identity through the Amazon.in logo positioned prominently on the left. This placement helps users immediately recognize the platform. The centrally aligned search bar allows users to quickly search for products, categories, or brands. Its size and placement ensure high visibility, encouraging frequent use. The inclusion of navigation and settings icons near the search bar provides easy access to additional options without cluttering the interface.

Below the header, the promotional banner section highlights ongoing offers such as the “New Year Sale.” This section uses visually appealing product images, discount messages, and clear typography to attract user attention. The horizontal scrolling feature enables multiple promotions to be displayed within limited screen space, ensuring dynamic content presentation while maintaining a clean layout.

The service highlights section is displayed using icons with descriptive labels such as Deals Today, Secure Payment, Free Delivery, Cash on Delivery, and Best Seller. These icons serve as trust indicators and quickly communicate key benefits of the platform. The use of recognizable symbols and concise text improves user understanding and reassures customers about the reliability of the service.

The navigation bar is placed at the bottom of the interface, following modern mobile design standards. It includes essential options such as Home, Deals, Orders, Cart, and Account. This fixed navigation bar ensures that users can easily move between major sections of the application at any time, enhancing accessibility and reducing navigation effort.
